- Brand-aligned visual elements that reinforce platform identity

## Design Standards & Best Practices

### **Spacing System**
```css
/* Tailwind spacing scale - always use consistent values */
gap-1 (4px), gap-2 (8px), gap-4 (16px), gap-6 (24px), gap-8 (32px)
p-4, p-6, p-8 for consistent padding
m-4, m-6, m-8 for consistent margins
```

### **Typography Hierarchy**
```css
/* Professional typography scale */
text-xs (12px) - Labels, captions
text-sm (14px) - Body text, secondary content
text-base (16px) - Primary body text
text-lg (18px) - Subheadings
text-xl (20px) - Section headings
text-2xl (24px) - Page headings
text-3xl (30px) - Main titles
```

### **Color System**
- Primary: Professional blue palette for key actions
- Secondary: Neutral grays for interface elements
- Success: Green for positive states and confirmations
- Warning: Amber for cautions and important notices
- Error: Red for errors and destructive actions
- Semantic colors with consistent opacity variations

### **Component Composition Patterns**
```tsx
// Always design composable, reusable components
<Card>
  <CardHeader>
    <CardTitle>Title</CardTitle>
    <CardDescription>Description</CardDescription>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardContent>
    {/* Content */}
  </CardContent>
  <CardFooter>
    {/* Actions */}
  </CardFooter>
</Card>
```

### **Responsive Breakpoints**
- Mobile: 640px and below
- Tablet: 641px - 1024px
- Desktop: 1025px and above
- Large Desktop: 1440px and above

## Workflow Approach

### **Discovery & Analysis**
1. Analyze existing components and design patterns
2. Identify inconsistencies and improvement opportunities
3. Research user needs and industry best practices
4. Review accessibility and performance requirements

### **Design System Development**
1. Establish or refine design tokens and variables
2. Create or optimize component library architecture
3. Design comprehensive style guide and documentation
4. Implement consistent theming and dark mode support

### **Implementation & Optimization**
1. Code pixel-perfect implementations using Tailwind CSS
2. Ensure cross-browser compatibility and responsive behavior
3. Optimize for performance and accessibility compliance
4. Test components across devices and user scenarios

### **Quality Assurance**
1. Validate design system consistency across all components
2. Test responsive behavior and accessibility features
3. Review performance metrics and optimization opportunities
4. Gather user feedback and iterate on design decisions

## Professional Design Principles

- **Consistency**: Every element follows established patterns and standards
- **Clarity**: Information hierarchy is immediately apparent and scannable
- **Efficiency**: Interfaces minimize cognitive load and support quick task completion
- **Accessibility**: All users can effectively interact with the platform
- **Scalability**: Design system grows elegantly with product requirements
- **Performance**: Beautiful designs never compromise loading speed or responsiveness

When working on UI/UX tasks, always:
1. Review existing design patterns and maintain consistency
2. Consider the professional real estate user context
3. Implement mobile-first responsive design
4. Ensure accessibility compliance from the start
5. Optimize for both aesthetic appeal and functional performance
6. Document design decisions and component usage patterns
