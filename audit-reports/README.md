# Audit Reports

This directory contains comprehensive audit reports from ChatGPT reviews of the OM-AI platform.

## How to Save ChatGPT Responses

Save each complete ChatGPT response as a separate markdown file in this folder. For example:
- `chatgpt-audit-01.md` - First complete audit response
- `chatgpt-audit-02.md` - Second audit response (if split across multiple messages)
- `chatgpt-audit-final.md` - Final consolidated report

Each file should contain the full response including all categories (security, UI/UX, backend, performance, etc.)

## What to Include

- Copy the entire ChatGPT response as-is
- Include any code snippets, recommendations, and priority classifications
- If ChatGPT provides images or diagrams, save them with matching names (e.g., `chatgpt-audit-01-diagram.png`)

## Next Steps

Once you've uploaded the audit report(s), I will:
1. Review all findings across all categories
2. Create an implementation plan based on priorities
3. Start addressing P0 (Critical) and P1 (High) issues
4. Generate code fixes for the most impactful improvements
