# Settings Page Functionality Analysis

## **FUNCTIONAL ‚úÖ**
1. **Tab Navigation** - All 4 tabs work (Profile, AI Preferences, Display, Account)
2. **Settings API Integration** - GET/PUT endpoints are fully implemented with validation
3. **Form State Management** - All form inputs update state properly
4. **AI Preferences** - Model selection, temperature, max tokens sliders work
5. **Display Settings** - Theme selection, language selection work
6. **Notification Toggles** - Email/push notification switches work
7. **Save Functionality** - Settings persist to database via API
8. **Authentication Protection** - Redirects to login if not authenticated
9. **Loading States** - Proper loading indicators throughout
10. **Typography System** - Consistent design system implementation

## **NON-FUNCTIONAL ‚ùå**

### **HIGH PRIORITY** üî¥
1. **Avatar Upload**
   - "Change Avatar" button is non-functional
   - No file upload or image processing logic
   - Avatar only shows initials fallback

2. **Password Change**
   - "Change Password" button is non-functional
   - No password update form or validation
   - No Supabase auth integration for password changes

3. **Missing Dependencies**
   - `auth-middleware.ts` - Referenced but doesn't exist
   - `user-preferences.ts` - Referenced but doesn't exist  
   - `feature-flags.ts` - Referenced but doesn't exist
   - Settings API will fail without these

### **MEDIUM PRIORITY** üü°
4. **Data Export**
   - "Export Data" button is non-functional
   - No data aggregation or export logic
   - Should export documents, chat history, preferences

5. **Account Deletion**
   - "Delete Account" button is non-functional
   - No confirmation modal or deletion process
   - Should handle cascading deletes and cleanup

6. **Theme Application**
   - Theme selection works but doesn't actually apply themes
   - Missing theme provider integration
   - No real-time theme switching

7. **Profile Updates**
   - Full name changes don't sync to Supabase user table
   - No validation or persistence for profile changes

### **LOW PRIORITY** üü¢
8. **Language Switching**
   - Language selection works but no i18n implementation
   - Would need full internationalization system

9. **Push Notifications**
   - Toggle works but no browser notification integration
   - Would need service worker implementation
