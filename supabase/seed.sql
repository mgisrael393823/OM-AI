-- Seed file for local development
-- Creates sample app data only (no auth schema manipulation)
-- Users will be created via Supabase Auth Admin API

-- Sample data will be inserted after user creation via Admin API
-- This seed file contains only app-schema tables, not auth tables

-- Sample app data will be added after user is created via Admin API
-- For now, keeping this minimal to avoid FK constraint issues
